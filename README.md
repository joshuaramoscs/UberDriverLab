# UberDriverLab
 * You will not be able to see the output in real time in the Simulation.txt file.
 * To see output, Simulation.txt MUST be closed, and can be opened once program finishes running.
 * NOTE: My input is no more than 379 minutes long (1 minute == 1 sec).
 * Simulation will stop if all clients are processed(which is at minute 379), or if time is up.
 * If you want to see the output in your IDE, just comment lines 51 and 52.
